# Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

#### Introduction
This project aims to segment customers based on their attributes using K-means clustering. By clustering customers into groups, businesses can better understand their behavior and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

#### Data Description
The dataset contains information about customers, including their demographic attributes and spending behavior. The columns include CustomerID, Gender, Married, Age, Graduated, Profession, WorkExperience, SpendingScore, FamilySize, Category, and Segmentation.

#### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Missing values are handled, and categorical variables are encoded.
2. **Feature Scaling:** Numeric features are scaled to ensure uniformity in distance calculations.
3. **K-means Clustering:** The K-means algorithm is applied to segment customers into distinct clusters based on their attributes.
4. **Interpretation:** The results of the clustering analysis are interpreted to identify meaningful customer segments.

#### Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `customer_segmentation.py` script to perform the clustering analysis.
4. Explore the results and insights gained from the analysis.

#### Results
The clustering analysis reveals distinct customer segments based on their demographic attributes and spending behavior. Visualizations are provided to illustrate the characteristics of each segment and guide marketing strategies.

#### Future Work
Future enhancements to the project could include:
- Refinement of clustering algorithms or exploration of alternative methods.
- Integration of additional data sources to enrich the analysis.
- Development of predictive models to anticipate customer behavior.

#### Contributing
Contributions to the project are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests, suggest improvements, or report any issues you encounter.
